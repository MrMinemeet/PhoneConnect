# PhoneConnect
 Connect your Phone to your PC and get alerted when a new notification arrives or transfer files between your phone and pc with ease.

## Status:
* Notification transfer to PC is currently being implemented


## Thought
Out thought is to get this app a bit like KDE Connect or the Apple Notification and File Transfer "System".
